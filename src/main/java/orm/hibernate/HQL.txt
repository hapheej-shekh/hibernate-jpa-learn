		Hibernate Query Language (HQL)
	--------------------------------------

Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, 
but instead of operating on tables and columns, 
HQL works with persistent objects and their properties

HQL queries are translated by Hibernate into conventional SQL queries


String hql = "FROM Employee";
Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
List results = query.list();

"FROM org.hibernate.beans.Employee";

"FROM Employee AS E";

"FROM Employee E";

"SELECT E.firstName FROM Employee E";

WHERE Clause
------------
	"FROM Employee E WHERE E.id = 10";

ORDER BY Clause
---------------
	"FROM Employee E WHERE E.id > 10 ORDER BY E.salary DESC";

	"FROM Employee E WHERE E.id > 10 ORDER BY E.firstName DESC, E.salary DESC ";

	"FROM Employee E WHERE E.id > 10 ORDER BY E.firstName DESC, E.salary DESC ";
	
GROUP BY Clause
---------------
	"SELECT SUM(E.salary), E.firtName FROM Employee E GROUP BY E.firstName";
	
Named Parameters
----------------
	String hql = "FROM Employee E WHERE E.id = :employee_id";
	Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
	query.setParameter("employee_id",10);
	List results = query.list();

UPDATE Clause
-------------
	"UPDATE Employee set salary = :salary WHERE id = :employee_id";
	Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
	query.setParameter("salary", 1000);
	query.setParameter("employee_id", 10);
	int result = query.executeUpdate();

DELETE Clause
-------------
	"DELETE FROM Employee WHERE id = :employee_id";
	Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
	query.setParameter("employee_id", 10);
	int result = query.executeUpdate();


INSERT Clause
-------------
HQL supports INSERT INTO clause only where 
records can be inserted from one object to another object.

	"INSERT INTO Employee(firstName, lastName, salary) 
	 SELECT firstName, lastName, salary FROM old_employee";


Aggregate Methods
-----------------
	"SELECT count(distinct E.firstName) FROM Employee E";

	avg(property-name), max(property-name), min(property-name), sum(property-name)
	
	
Pagination
----------
	String hql = "FROM Employee";
	Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
	query.setFirstResult(1);
	query.setMaxResults(10);
	List results = query.list();
